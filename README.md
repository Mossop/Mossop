### Hello!

I like to write code. I like to [experiment with new things](https://github.com/Mossop/file-store-rs), or try to [solve problems](https://github.com/Mossop/es6-module-use-cycles) that annoy me and maybe no-one else. I have all sorts of cool ideas for [things](https://github.com/Mossop/musicbox-rs) to [build](https://github.com/Mossop/media-metadata) and sometimes I even start building them. I generally don't finish, once I've done the interesting bits that teach me something or prove that something can be done the grind of shipping isn't something I have much interest in doing in my spare time. But who knows, one day maybe I'll ship something!

In my day job I work on the [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com) web browser as the joint module owner of the front-end and member of the top-level module committee.

Not so long ago I found an archive of my old subversion server and so there are a whole bunch of my ancient projects up here. Don't judge the code too harshly, I'm sure your code wasn't fantastic 20 years ago!
